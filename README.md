# Results Analysis

After implementing the necessary changes in the code, I successfully displayed the cities on the map using GeoViews and hvplot. The city points are colored according to their names and sized according to their maximum temperature. This offers a visual representation of city locations and their corresponding maximum temperatures. I also managed to display the additional information ("Hotel Name", "Country", and "Current Description") when hovering over the city points. This interactive feature provides detailed data for each city without cluttering the map view.

I encountered some issues with generating the route path for the cities. After adjusting the parameters for the GeoViews' Path function, the route path was successfully displayed. It offers a red line indicating the  path of the cities to visit. Despite the initial issues and challenges, the final map provides a comprehensive and interactive overview of the vacation itinerary. Future improvements could include adding more detailed information or additional visual elements to enhance the map's usability and appeal.
